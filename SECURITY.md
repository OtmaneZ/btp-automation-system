## � Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Multi-factor Authentication** (MFA) for admin accounts
- **Session-based authentication** with secure token management
- **Role-based access control** (RBAC) with principle of least privilege
- **Brute force protection** with IP blocking after 5 failed attempts

### Data Protection
- **End-to-end encryption** for sensitive client data
- **AES-256 encryption** for data at rest
- **TLS 1.3** for all data in transit
- **Secure key management** with environment variable isolation

### Infrastructure Security
```yaml
Web Application Firewall (WAF):    ✅ Active
DDoS Protection:                   ✅ Cloudflare
SSL/TLS Certificates:              ✅ Auto-renewal
Security Headers:                  ✅ HSTS, CSP, XSS Protection
Database Security:                 ✅ Encrypted, Access Controls
```

### Code Security
- **Static Application Security Testing** (SAST) integrated in CI/CD
- **Dependency vulnerability scanning** with automated updates
- **Input validation** and sanitization on all user inputs
- **SQL injection prevention** through parameterized queries
- **XSS protection** via content security policy headers

---

## 🔍 Security Monitoring

### Real-time Monitoring
- **UptimeRobot**: 99.267% availability monitoring
- **Security event logging** with anomaly detection
- **Failed authentication tracking** and alerting
- **File integrity monitoring** for critical system files

### Automated Security Checks
```python
# Daily automated security scans
- Vulnerability assessment
- Port scanning detection
- SSL certificate validation
- Database integrity checks
- Log analysis for suspicious activity
```

### Incident Response
1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring triggers alert
2. **Assessment**: Security team evaluates threat level
3. **Containment**: Immediate isolation of affected systems
4. **Eradication**: Root cause analysis and vulnerability patching
5. **Recovery**: Service restoration with enhanced monitoring
6. **Lessons Learned**: Post-incident review and process improvement

## 🏢 Client Data Security

### Data Classification
| Data Type | Classification | Encryption | Retention |
|-----------|---------------|------------|-----------|
| **Client PII** | Confidential | AES-256 | 7 years |
| **Financial Data** | Restricted | AES-256 | 10 years |
| **Business Analytics** | Internal | AES-128 | 5 years |
| **System Logs** | Internal | TLS 1.3 | 2 years |

### GDPR Compliance
- **Data minimization**: Only collect necessary information
- **Right to erasure**: Automated data deletion upon request
- **Data portability**: Export functionality for client data
- **Consent management**: Granular privacy controls
- **Breach notification**: 72-hour reporting requirement

### Client Privacy Controls
- **Opt-out mechanisms** for all data collection
- **Anonymous analytics** where possible
- **Secure data sharing** with explicit consent only
- **Regular data audits** and cleanup procedures
